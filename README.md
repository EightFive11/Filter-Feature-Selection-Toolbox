# Simple-Filter-Feature-Selection-Algorithms
This toolbox contains four commonly used filter feature selection algorithms (1) Relief-F (RF) (2) Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) (3) F-score (FS) (4) Term Variance (TV) 

The "Main" script shows the examples on how to use these filter feature selection programs with the benchmark data set.
